#imagine you have a heap and you want to increase the one of the values! 
#well, after increasing the value at any given index, it may destroy the heap property and you will have to re-organise the heap.

#1. update the value with the key given
# for max hap, check if the key is greater than its parent, if so, we need to percolate up!
#How do we percolate up?
